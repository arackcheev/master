## Decred [DCR]
#### Issue #1:
* Using CMD line wallet due to issues with Paymetheus
  * See CMD line setup here: https://github.com/Aderks/master/blob/master/decredSETUP.md

* Achieve resp 200 on Decred but with errors:

```
[I] 2017-Jul-30 09:48:57 [0x2] HTTP: resp 200 {"result":{"default":0,"imported":0,"testDECRED":0},"error":null,"id":1}

```

* With the error Block calls/recieves wallet and balance information from Decred
* Most likely the reason for Issue #2

#### Issue #2:
* When creating a new TX, and hit Post, we get a "invalid TX address"

* Decred uses a 35 character address, whereas the majority of others use 34 and sometimes 33 character addresses

 * Attempts were made to decompress base58 and remove the last 4 bytes for checksum, and the 2nd byte for color byte
 * With the removal of the 2nd byte of HEX, we then converted back to Base 58 and forced a TX off that address, see below:
