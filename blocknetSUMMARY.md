# Overview

## What Blocknet Is
The Blocknet is infrastructure for the coming “inter-blockchain era,” an emerging technology epoch characterised primarily by the superseding of the current API ecosystem with an intrinsically monetizable “token ecosystem.” 

From the perspective of blockchain technology, if blockchains are to achieve their true potential, then broad, generic interoperability between blockchain services is required. Without inter-chain interoperability, blockchain-based services will (a) either deliver services only within the confines of the limited customer base that runs its nodes, or sacrifice the unique security properties of blockchains in delivering to centralized entities, and (b) face enduring problems with chain bloat and, relatedly, the market-related pressure to build further features onto a single chain. 

From the perspective of software-as-a-service (SaaS), the token ecosystem embodies two fundamental advancements: (a) the comparatively frictionless monetisation of services, and (b) the leveraging of the unique robustness, decentralization, and security properties of blockchain technology. 

By creating an “internet of blockchains,” the Blocknet is positioned to enable the frictionless monetisation of APIs, and in doing so, to empower blockchain technology by converting its thousands of isolated chains into a token ecosystem. 

## What Blocknet Enables 
 * The delivery of potentially any kind of digital service from a node on any blockchain to another. 

 * The ability for any given blockchain service to function not as an “appcoin” but as a “protocol service,” that is, to be consumable by any other dapp anywhere, instead of only by its community, greatly enlarging the service’s market reach and revenue stream. 

 * The ability for smart contracts to function not as “dapps” but as “protocol tokens,” where their code quality may benefit from a broad contributor-base of developers from diverse communities, exploit their combined learnings, prevent chain bloat and the duplication of code and labour, and deliver services to the entire blockchain-consuming market, instead of just the set of users of its blockchain. 

 * The ability to create dapps with a multi-chain architecture, leveraging relevant services no matter which chain they are available on, rendering nugatory the (currently-difficult) choice of blockchain.

 * The capacity for a microservices architecture, where each blockchain delivers a single service, integrated with many others in a modular fashion, providing simpler component design, easier bug-fixing, and easier upgrading. 

 * The monetisation of inter-chain and multi-chain services, using their intrinsic tokens of value. 

 * The full exploitation of the new, cryptoeconomically-driven business models ushered in by blockchain technology, in which a business may extract value from a “better than free” model, from monetary policy directly (ICOs, transaction fees, deflationary economics, etc), and from a marketplace for its monetized APIs. 

## How It Works
In brief, the Blocknet supplies three core services for inter-chain interoperability: service lookup, inter-chain messaging, and decentralized exchange. These are currently implemented in a monolithic app, xbridgep2p.exe, and modularisation of components, and abstraction of services into API façade(s) are planned.

## Supported Coins
Any coin that supports OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and has a stock JSON RPC interface cloned from Bitcoin Core will “just work” - which are most coins.

The following is a list of coins which have been tested and are confirmed to be supported and compatible. Any two coins from this list are a valid coin pair and can be traded directly. 

 * Bitcoin (BTC)
 * Dash (DASH)
 * DigiByte (DGB)
 * Dynamic (DYN)
 * Litecoin (LTC)
 * SysCoin (SYS)
 * Vertcoin (VTC)
 * Viacoin (VIA)
