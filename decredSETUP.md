# Decred CMD Line Setup For Blocknet DX

* Go to: https://github.com/decred/decred-release/releases/tag/v1.0.5

* Download: `dcrinstall-windows-amd64-v1.0.5.exe`

* Run the .exe

* Find the directory, it should be: `C:\Users\<NAME>\decred\ `

---

* Open 3 cmd prompt windows
  * On all 3, change the directory to the source directory:
  
	  `cd C:\Users\<NAME>\decred` or wherever it was installed
    
## 1ST CMD PROMPT WINDOW

* Type:

  * `dcrd --notls --rpcuser=CHANGE --rpcpass=CHANGE --minrelaytxfee=0.01 --rpclisten=127.0.0.1`
  	* (change rpc user/pass)

* It will then connect and download the blockchain. Leave this running in the background

## 2ND CMD PROMPT WINDOW

* Type: `dcrwallet --create`

* Create and enter a password (it wont display anything when you type a password) 

* Type it again to confirm

* Type `n` on addition security

* Type: `n` on an exisiting wallet

* Copy your Seed and Hex into a document and save it

* Type: `OK`  (capital letters)

* Your wallet should be created successfully!

## 3RD CMD PROMPT WINDOW

* Type:

	* `dcrwallet --username=CHANGE --password=CHANGE --noclienttls --noservertls --walletpass public --dcrdusername=CHANGE --dcrdpassword=CHANGE --txfee=0.01`
		* (enter the same user/pass as the above RPC for both user/pass)

* Enter your password, it should rescan blocks and eventually connect
  
* Leave it running in the background

## BACK TO 2ND CMD PROMPT WINDOW

* Type: 

	* `dcrctl -u CHANGE -P CHANGE --wallet --notls walletpassphrase <password> 1000000`
		* (-u and -P is your user/pass from above. "password" is your wallet password, but don’t use the <> symbols)

* It should take you back to the directory

* Type: 

	* `dcrctl -u CHANGE -P CHANGE --wallet --notls createnewaccount "testDECRED"`
		* (“testDECRED” is what I am calling my labelled address, use the quotation marks and label it whatever you want)

* It should take you back to the directory

* Type:

	* `dcrctl -u CHANGE -P CHANGE --wallet --notls getnewaddress "testDECRED"`
		* (getnewaddress " " is whatever you wrote on the above command for a label)

* This should output your labelled DCR address
